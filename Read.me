# Dashboard for Analyzing Trifásica Power, Rainfall, and Temperature

This project utilizes Python and the Dash framework to create a data visualization dashboard for analyzing the relationship between trifásica power (p3), rainfall, and temperature across different time periods.

## Features
- **Data Import and Processing**: Reads monthly Excel files for 2017, 2018, and 2019. Filters and cleans the data to include only valid temperature and power readings.
- **Data Aggregation**: Combines data from multiple years and calculates daily, business day, weekly, monthly, and half-year rolling averages.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Daily trends for power, rainfall, and temperature.
  - Business-day trends.
  - Weekly, monthly, and half-year rolling averages for comparative insights.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Plotly and Dash for dynamic and interactive visualizations.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following libraries are installed:
- Dash
- Plotly
- Pandas
- Numpy
- OpenPyXL (for reading Excel files)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system (version 3.8 or higher recommended).
3. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Place the data files (xlsx and csv) in the appropriate folders as described in the Data Structure section.
5. Run the application:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
6. Open the browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/.

### File Requirements
- The `xlsx` files contain monthly power data split by campus and year.
- The `csv` files store climate data, including temperature and rainfall, for corresponding years.
- Ensure file names and structures match the expected format for seamless integration.
